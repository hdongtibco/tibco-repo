    <!-- This file contains properties which are specific to each user/machine.
            Please examine each property and modify it for your configuration -->

    <!-- autobuild.configuration.post-1.1:
            This is a magic upgrade property.  Just leave it alone. -->
    <property name="autobuild.configuration.post-1.1" value="true" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.java-classes:
            This is the location of the JRE that you want to use to run ant, Eclipse,
            and builder.   The folder specified must contain rt.jar (or the equivalent).
            The default value is very likely to be incorrect, even on Windows. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.java-classes"
              location="c:/program files/java/jdk1.5.0/jre/lib" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.eclipse:
            For 1.2 and later, this should be a bare Eclipse installation.
            For 1.1, modify the first property in the compatibility file.
            The default is very likely to be incorrect, even on Windows. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.eclipse"
              location="c:/program files/eclipse/3.2" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.user:
            The default location is the directory that contains this file.
            Changing it may be convenient, but is particularly useful for release.
            This is the base directory for most configuration and output. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.user"
              location="${user.home}/tibco-build" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.candidates:
            The output location for build candidates (the output of builder).
            The default value is a folder next to this file, which should be fine for
            most people. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.candidates"
              location="${autobuild.dir.user}/candidates" />

    <!-- autobuild.workspace.lgpl-cache:
            If you are working on a project with dependencies on features with
            restrictive licenses, you will need to install those materials
            (manually), then point this property at the location where
            they were installed (typically ending in "components/eclipse").
            Others should leave this commented out. -->

    <!-- 1.1 compatibility:
            The following properties enable 1.1 compatibility, permitting one
            configuration to be used for both 1.1 and 1.2 builds, triggered off
            the build script in the release unit.  Don't edit these; do edit
            the file pointed at (builder-1.1-compatibility.xml) if you will
            be using both 1.1 and 1.2 to build different release units. -->
