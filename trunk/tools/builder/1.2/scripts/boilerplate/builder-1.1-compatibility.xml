            The location of builder, and of the scripts which are the key
            entry points, are identified by concatenating the above eclipse
            location, the id of the builder plugin, and the version specified.
            When you update builder, also update this version and leave the
            rest alone, and everything should work. -->

            As with builder, the standard location of the workspace installer
            (a jar rather than a dir) is specified relative to the eclipse
            location and the version of the plugin.  Change the value of
            the version property when you upgrade, and it should work -->
